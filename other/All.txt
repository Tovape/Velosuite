Loading:

On Finishing:
Publish in producthunt

Code:
For themes it must use EJS, it will navigate into a theme's folder where it will get all the buttons, dropdowns etc, then by js or language the content of the
button, dropdown, option etc, will be filled
for example there will be a folder called themes and inside it there'll be a unique theme by name

/themes/default/dropdown.ejs
/themes/default/button.ejs

this will be called by ejs include and a parameter from NodeJS which is the active theme, on further development the themes will need a controlled for downloading it,
since it will be better, it's just downloading a folder and removing it from the user interface
this app will need a dev section with some button to empty cache
